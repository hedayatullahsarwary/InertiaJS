## Build Modern Laravel Apps Using Inertia.js

***Inertia.js***, created by Jonathan Reinink, is an incredible tool that glues a server-side framework, like Laravel, to a client-side framework, like Vue. Think of it as a new way to build traditional server-driven applications. With Inertia, you can continue using server-side routing, and controllers, and authentication, and validation. With Inertia, you don't need to learn how to build an API, and you definitely don't need to use OAuth. Instead, relax and continue creating apps the way you traditionally would. 

### Cloning the Repository
    1. First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
        - cd: to change your working directory.
        - cd ../ to "go back" a level in your directory tree.
    2. Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:
        - git clone https://github.com/hedayatullahsarwary/InertiaJS.git
    3. Now you can see the contents of the remote repository on your machine by moving into the newly cloned directory:
        - cd InertiaJS/
        - ls -la
