## Build Modern Laravel Apps Using Inertia.js

***Inertia.js***, created by Jonathan Reinink, is an incredible tool that glues a server-side framework, like Laravel, to a client-side framework, like Vue. Think of it as a new way to build traditional server-driven applications. With Inertia, you can continue using server-side routing, and controllers, and authentication, and validation. With Inertia, you don't need to learn how to build an API, and you definitely don't need to use OAuth. Instead, relax and continue creating apps the way you traditionally would.
